## How it all started

Back in 2022 I needed to find some bugs as i newly begun hunting and was eager to copy, spray or run any payload, just to see an 
'alert (1)'ðŸ˜‚.

## The first pick

Hackerone brought in Temu and it was introduced to nigerian hackers, i decided started to testing for buisness logic, rate limiting and SQL, since it was looking fresh.

Welp, nothing was there for me.(Unlucky asf), but here's what i learnt from trying to get a bug from temu:

## The waste of time

- Their excessive use of captcha would make you give up, even when you try to dig deeper into the oauth it burns you down.
- The payment gateway was all a false positive with postmessage and csp rules fooling the hungry minds.
- Cart synchronization issues, the cart updated were not shown on websites if the payment was made on a phone or any other devices*(race bug)* (A bug esty or amazon would give you a solid $300 for, what a shame!)
- Worst shipping trackers, it's just too fancy.
- Incorrect or broken product images, particularly if images do not match the item descriptions.
- Malwarelized mobile app (i always thought so for no reasons sorryðŸ˜‚).

## The final chapter
The best and worst advice to give a bug hunter is to move on from a cool program when nothing is actually working out. I found a xss, i tried a lot of things but account takeovers didn't work pretty fine for me back then, so i tried the xss on carts too it worked but this time it was reflected on the mobile and other devices*(shokingly)*. Well i Won't disclose any further but i,

sent a report on a friday ðŸ˜‚, got an answer in the evening and it was a bit harsh but as usual i landed a N/A, i moved on like everyone else, not happy because i couldn't get something off them. Well maybe next time!.

## Update: Feb 2024

I think they've fixed some things but still i haven't gotten a pay from temu yet on any past bugs.(Not XSS btw)
