## How it all started

Back in 2022 I needed to find some bugs as i newly begun hunting and was eager to copy, spray or run any payload just to see an 
'alert (1)'ðŸ˜‚.

## The first pick

Hackerone brought in Temu and it was being introduced to nigerian hackers, i decided started to testing for buisness logic, rate limiting and SQL, since it was looking fresh,
welp their was nothing there for me(Unlucky asf), here's what i learnt from trying to get a bug from temu:

## The waste of time

- Their excessive use of captcha would make you give up, even when you try to dig the oauth it burns you down
- Payment gateway was all a false positive with postmessage and csp rules fooling the hungry mind
- Cart synchronization issues, the cart updated were not shown on websites if the payment was made on a phone (A bug esty or amazon would give you a solid $300 for, what a shame!)
- Worst shipping trackers, it's just too fancy
- Incorrect or broken product images, particularly if images do not match the item descriptions.
- Malwarelized mobile app (i always thought so for no reasonsðŸ˜‚)

## The final chapter
The best and worst advice to give a bug hunter is to move on from a cool program when nothing is working out. I found a xss, i tried a lot of things but account takeovers didn't work pretty fine for me back then, so i tried the xss on carts too it worked but this time it was reflected on the mobile device. Won't disclose further.

Sent a report friday ðŸ˜‚, got an answer the evening a bit harsh but as usual i landed a N/A, i moved like everyone but i'm not happy because i couldn't get something off them. Well maybe next time!.

## Update: Feb 2024

I think they've fixed some things but still haven't gotten a pay from temu yet on any past bugs.(Not XSS btw)
